<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the site is to publicise the company through the web media and help it suceed in the near future and also  be the most wanted fancy costume company available. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Sucess would be gained when this company becomes the ultimate or the most famous one step destination to buy various costumes</p>
<p>Success would be evaluated by ratio of number of orders placed to the total stock ratio..When the numbers of orders exceeds the total stock it is understood that the company has achieved its motive and has exceled in the chosen field.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We target audience  from 3years to 30years as  the younger generation are our skipping stones to success and also are our main investors.Other than younger and teenegers we also motivate people above 30years of age to attend various costume parties and events .</p>
